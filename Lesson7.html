            City life is full of fun. There are parks and picnic spots to visit. We have cinema halls
            to see movies. We have electricity which runs our factories, light and cools our
             home and helps us in seeing T.V. There are all type of amenities like water, health
              checkup and transport. Sometimes circusc shows entertain the city people.
